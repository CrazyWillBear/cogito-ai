# Research LangGraph

## Overview
This is the LangGraph/LangChain component of what will become a larger academic research tool. The goal of this project
is to assist scholars in their research with AI tools, enabling them to gather and analyze information from various
sources. This project is in *very* early stages of development. For information, keep up with my blog, where I'm writing
about the development process: [writing.capbear.net](https://writing.capbear.net).
