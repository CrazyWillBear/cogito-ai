The obligation is **a\u2011priori**, independent of consequences or external authority. | Obligations arise from **social pressure** and the **threat of punishment** (or loss of esteem). \u201cNo man escapes the punishment of their censure and dislike who offends against the fashion and opinion of the company he keeps\u201d (Leviathan, To Honour and Dishonour). |\n| **Motivation** | Pure *respect for the moral law*; actions have moral worth only when done **solely from duty**, not from self\u2011interest or emotion. | Primarily **self\u2011interest** in maintaining a good reputation; moral behaviour is a means to secure honour and avoid the pain of contempt. |\n| **Universality** | Moral maxims must be **universally applicable**; the categorical imperative guarantees that a principle can be willed as a law for all rational beings. | Moral norms are **contingent on the particular society** and its conventions; what counts as honourable varies with \u201cfashion and opinion of the company.\u201d |\n| **Method of Discovery** | **A\u2011priori analysis** of concepts such as *good will*, *duty*, and *respect for the law*; no empirical observation is required (SEP, Johnson & Cureton, *Kant\u2019s Moral Philosophy*, 1\u20113). | **Empirical observation** of human behaviour and social interaction; morality is inferred from the way people actually seek honour and avoid censure (Project Gutenberg, Hobbes, *Leviathan*, \u201cTo Honour and Dishonour\u201d). |\n| **Role of Reason** | Reason is the **sole legislator** of moral law; autonomy means the will is self\u2011governed by rational principles. | Reason is instrumental: it helps individuals calculate how to obtain honour or avoid punishment, but it does not generate moral law itself. |\n| **Ultimate Aim** | The **Highest Good**: a union of perfect virtue and (ideally) happiness, justified by the rational postulates of freedom, God, and immortality (SEP, Johnson & Cureton, *Kant\u2019s Moral Philosophy*, 1\u20113). | The **peaceful commonwealth**: moral rules are justified insofar as they secure social order and protect individuals from the \u201cwar of all against all\u201d (Leviathan, overall project). |\n\n### Brief Comparative Summary\n- **Kant** treats morality as a matter of **rational autonomy**: the *good will* is good \u201cwithout qualification,\u201d and moral duties are derived from the categorical imperative, a universal, a\u2011priori principle that commands action **solely out of respect for the law** (SEP, Johnson & Cureton, *Kant\u2019s Moral Philosophy*, 2\u20113).  \n- **Hobbes** sees morality as **socially constructed**: what counts as right or wrong is determined by the **desire for honour** and the **avoidance of dishonour**, which are enforced by the fear of censure and the need for reputation within a community (Leviathan, \u201cTo Honour and Dishonour\u201d).\n\nThus, Kant\u2019s definition is **normative and universal**, rooted in pure reason, whereas Hobbes\u2019s definition is **descriptive and contingent**, rooted in human psychology and the pragmatic demands of social life.\n\n---\n\n## References\n- **SEP**, Johnson, Robert & Cureton, Adam, *Kant\u2019s Moral Philosophy*, sections\u202f2\u202f(Good Will, Moral Worth and Duty) and\u202f3\u202f(Duty and Respect for Moral Law).  \n- **Project Gutenberg**, Thomas Hobbes, *Leviathan*, \u201cTo Honour and Dishonour\u201d.",
